## Overview

Welcome to **Cosmic Care**, an innovative emotional wellness web app that transforms your daily emotional journey into an interactive 3D solar system experience. Track your emotional states across morning, afternoon, and evening sessions while visualizing your emotional patterns through stunning 3D graphics and intuitive calendar views.

The app features a **3D Solar System Visualization** where each planet represents a daily session, and emotional states orbit as moons around their respective planets. Users can explore their emotional data through both immersive 3D interactions and comprehensive calendar analytics.
The **Calendar View** provides a GitHub-style heatmap showing emotional intensity patterns over time, with color-coded gradients representing positive, negative, and balanced emotional states.
